COVID-19 Prediction Project Summary
Objective:
To predict COVID-19 case counts using machine learning techniques, focusing on time-series analysis and regression models.

Data Collection:
Data sourced from a CSV file containing daily COVID-19 cases.
Data includes columns like Date and Confirmed cases.
Data Preprocessing:
Convert Date column to datetime format.
Set Date as the index.
Forward-fill missing values to handle gaps in the data.
Feature Engineering:
Create a new feature 'Day' representing the number of days since the first recorded date.
Model Training:
Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor used for prediction.
Split data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
Evaluation Metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
R² Score: Indicates proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables.
Libraries Used:
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical operations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning model building and evaluation.
Results:
Models evaluated using MSE and R² score to determine accuracy.
Visualizations created to understand trends and model performance.
Conclusion:
The project successfully demonstrates the use of machine learning to predict COVID-19 cases, leveraging time-series data and regression techniques. It highlights the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation in building accurate predictive models.
